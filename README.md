# kofi-discord-notification
Serverless Express app running on Netlify functions to send Ko-fi notification to Discord.

## Why?
Ko-fi currently has Discord Integration which only does role assignment but not message notification on donation. I found [a Node.js script](https://github.com/eramsorgr/kofi-discord-alerts) to achieve this goal but unfortunately it needed a constantly running server environment, as well as your own domain to avoid exposing the server IP address. Hence, I modified it to make it run on [Netlify Functions](https://functions.netlify.com/), and you also get a free Netlify subdomain.

You can also deploy this simple script on an already existing Netlify website if you have one, just remember to include the extra dependencies in your main `package.json` and update your env variables.
